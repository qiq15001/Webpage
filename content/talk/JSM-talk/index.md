abstract: "The objective is to address the research question of NYCHVS in the ASA Data Challenge Expo, which is to describe changes in housing conditions for the first and the second-generation immigrant householders in NYC. The changes in Utility cost is an interesting topic and may also be related to housing condition changes. A R shiny app will be constructed to visually show the changes in housing conditions. The map of NYC will be represented in the app. Given the input of region, the region on the map could be highlighted or zoomed in. The housing conditions will be classified into external condition of buildings (such as external wall, windows), internal condition of the building (such as elevators, floors), condition of room facilities (such as heating, kitchen facilities). Given either one of the class as input, the changes will be shown by summary statistics and trend plots. Demographic information of the first-generation and second-generation may also be combined. I would investigate whether demographic information alters the changes in housing condition and cost, and the relation between housing condition and utility cost."
